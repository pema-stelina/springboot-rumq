# Introduction

### What is Spring Boot?
- Spring boot is a Java based framework.

### What would we use instead of frameworks?
- We would use libraries

### What is the difference between libraries and frameworks?
Libraries are collections of classes (jars) that do the most of the work for us while a framework is an application. Another difference is that the libraries get called by our code, while the framework calls our code.


### What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot

When the framwework first came out, it came out as Spring. Java Enterprise Edition had a lot of details and was very complicated. People started using Spring instead.Then, they realized that Spring needed a lot of configuration, for example, if you wanted a java object you had to add the name of the class in a xml file otherwise it wouldn't be created. So, instead of writing Java code, they were writing more xlm files. 
Then, SPring Boot came out and the difference is that it does not need configuration. Spring Boot is an opinionated framework and instead of using xml files, it uses Java annotations. 




bean is different from the object because it is seriazable and it needs to have a setName method if it has a name property. It cannot be a setStelinaName just like in normal Java code.


What is a singleton?

if you keep talking the same class multiple times you get the reference of the same object.
